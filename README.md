# TI-Tanks by Connor McDonald and Krish Singh

You can watch a demo here!  https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Xj_KYZfzogk

A top-down 2-player game inspired by the classic game "Tank Trouble", where your goal is to destroy your opponent's tank before they destroy yours. Each player will have a slide pot to turn their tank. They also have 3 buttons each, one for shooting, moving forward, and activating power-ups. The shooting button and power-ups have cooldowns; an in-game sound indicates the power-up availability, and onboard LED lights on the game's PCB.  The bullets are released from the direction the player is facing. The bullets ricochet off the environment (walls) without losing momentum, but eventually disappear. The dash allows for dodging by quickly moving in the direction being faced. Each player has 1-7 (customizable) health points; getting hit by any bullet (even yours) decreases the HP by 1. Once a player reaches 0 hp, they lose, and the other player wins. The game features 3 different power-ups that arrive at certain intervals and last ~10 seconds.
